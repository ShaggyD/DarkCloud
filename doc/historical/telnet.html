        <h2>The Telnet Protocol</h2>
        Muds communicate with their clients with the Telnet protocol. You shouldn't write a mud client
        or server without reading RFCs <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc854.html">854</a> and
        <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc855.html">855</a>, which specify this.

        Most clients and servers do not implement the full protocol. In particular, it is rare for
        options to be renegotiable.  Accordingly, both ends should be tolerant.
    <p>
        The Telnet protocol uses 0xff as an escape character, both ways.  To send the data-byte 0xff,
        a client or server MUST send 0xff 0xff. (IAC IAC).
    <p>
        If a program justs want to ignore the telnet stuff, then it's easy to do.
    <p>
<pre>
  IAC IAC -> data byte 255
  IAC WILL/WONT/DO/DONT xxx -> ignore
  IAC SB xxx ... IAC SE -> ignore
  IAC other -> ignore
</pre>
    <p>
        The telnet parser MUST be written as a state machine on a layer on its own - there's no reason
        why telnet sequences are not allowed to come in the middle of an escape sequence.
        Do not assume that telnet or ansi sequences are not split across packets.
    <p>
        The client MUST defer sending its own telnet negotiation requests until such time as it
        knows the server will be able to understand them.  This means getting WILL or DO request
        for an option other than ECHO. (Many Dikus and derivatives are broken such that
        if the client sends IAC WILL LINEMODE, they fail to filter out the LINEMODE (it being 34, and thus
        the printable character "), and think it intended as part of the user name.  If the server
        sends IAC sequences to a client that it doesn't know supports it, the worst that can happen
        is that the client displays crap on the screen.)
    <p>
        The character set used by the Telnet protocol is US-ASCII.  Servers MAY use another character set
        appropriate to the language of the mud (for example, ISO-8859-1, KOI8-R) by default, but there
        SHOULD be an option to send only ASCII.  Obviously this requirement doesn't make sense for languages
        where transliteration is expensive.  Clients MUST be able to deal with the usual encoding
        for their locale.  For example, a mud client aimed at western users MUST be able to deal with
        ISO-8859-1.
    <p>
        (According to the Telnet spec, only US-ASCII is allowed on the wire. However, there's no useful
        way of negotiating - <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2066.html">RFC 2066</a>'s CHARSET
        option is hardly implemented, and ISO-2022 is useless for most character sets. Further, even binary
        mode is not useful, as it changes the end-of-line codes from the standard values to platform-specific
        ones.  Therefore, BINARY mode MUST NOT be requested by servers or clients, however clients MAY
        accept it if offered.)
        <h2>Ansi Sequences</h2>
        Telnet makes no guarantees that what is at the other end is a terminal capable of parsing
        ANSI sequences.  However any mud client that cannot is clearly deficient.  In the
        <a href="/telnet">survey</a>, a few of these were discovered - all of which are unmaintained.
        As long as the server keeps itself to a limited set, all is safe.
        See <a href="http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/STAND/ECMA-048.HTM">ECMA 48</a> (downloadable for free as a pdf) for the full details,
        the minimal collection is -
    <p>
        <table border=1>
            <tr><td>code<td>meaning
            <tr><td>ESC[0m<td>reset all attributes and colours to default
            <tr><td>ESC[1m<td>bold
            <tr><td>ESC[3m<td>italic (unreliable)
            <tr><td>ESC[4m<td>underline (unreliable)
            <tr><td>ESC[22m<td>bold off (unreliable)
            <tr><td>ESC[23m<td>italic off (unreliable)
            <tr><td>ESC[24m<td>underline off (unreliable)
            <tr><td>ESC[30m ... ESC[37m<td>black fg .. white fg
            <tr><td>ESC[39m<td>default fg (unreliable)
            <tr><td>ESC[40m ... ESC[47m<td>black bg .. white fg
            <tr><td>ESC[49m<td>default fg (unreliable)
        </table>
    <p>
        The client MUST default to white-on-black or some other light-on-dark colour scheme where neither
        the background nor the foreground is one of the 7 other standard colours.  If it doesn't, then
        the server has no way of using colour safely.  The client MAY allow the user to customise their
        colour scheme to be black-on-white or however they like.
    <p>
        ESC[m is defined to be an alias for ESC[0m, but quite a lot of mud clients don't know this. Many
        even have problems with parsing sequences like ESC[0;1;3;32;45m.  These MUST be supported by clients,
        but SHOULD NOT be sent by servers.
    <p>
        XFree86 xterm (when compiled to) supports a very useful extension to a 256-colour thing, including a
        6x6x6 colour cube. To set fg, do ESC[38;5;<i>n</i>m, and bg ESC[48;5;<i>n</i>m.  There is no need
        in a mud server to worry about programming the palette, the mud client should do any reprogramming
        of the palette to the standard one if possible. 0..15 are the regular colours, once in normal form,
        one in bright form. 16-231 are a 6x6x6 colour cube. To get the offset, (red * 36) + (green * 6) + blue.
        Finally, 232-255 is a greyscale. 232 is very dark gray, 255 is very light gray.  See xterm's 256colres.h
        for the exact RGB values.
    <p>
        Any other sequences than ESC[...m are not implemented by most mud clients and SHOULD NOT be used
        unless known safe through other means.  This includes cursor movement.
        <h2>Input and Echo</h2>
        Local echo MUST be on by default.  Many muds are designed to work with telnet, and expect echo to be
        on, unless they turn it off.  This means that after a prompt, they will not supply their own newline,
        having expected the client to have put one in the buffer for them.
        <table border=1>
            <tr><td><td>broken client<td>nice client
            <tr><td>user sees...<td><pre>&gt;<td><pre>&gt;
            <tr><td>user inputs....<td><pre>look<td><pre>look
            <tr>
                <td>user sees...
                <td><pre>&gt;You are standing in Muon's Bar.
                <td>
                    <pre>&gt;look
You are standing in Muon's Bar.
        </table>
    <p>
        A "turn local echo off always" MAY be provided, but the newline must still be printed even if this is
        turned on.  Likewise, if the mud has turned echo off, you MUST NOT put anything into the buffer, as the
        mud supplies its own newline.
        <h2>Telnet Options - Echo</h2>
        The mud sends "IAC WILL ECHO", meaning "I, the server, will do any echoing from now on." The client
        should acknowledge this with an IAC DO ECHO, and then stop putting echoed text in the input buffer.
        It should also do whatever is appropriate for password entry to the input box thing - for example,
        it might * it out.  Text entered in server-echoes mode should also not be placed any command history.
    <p>
        When the mud wants the client to start local echoing again, it sends "IAC WONT ECHO" - the client
        must respond to this with "IAC DONT ECHO".
    <p>
        See <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc857.html">RFC 857</a>.
        <h2>Prompts</h2>
        Most muds (aber, dikus, lps, but not mushes or moos), use prompts.  These are tricky things.  The server
        wants the prompt to be displayed to the left of the input line.  In a terminal-based
        mud client this often no problem to arrange, and no special prompt detection is needed.  However,
        GUI apps will need to be able to distinguish a prompt from a line that just hasn't come in yet.
    <p>
        The usual way of doing this is (a) to send IAC GA after a prompt, or (b) for the mud to send IAC WILL
        TELOPT_EOR, then the client to send IAC DO TELOPT_EOR, and then the mud will send IAC EOR after every prompt. (see
        <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc885.html">RFC 885</a> for EOR).
        According to the tinyfugue documents, some muds use "*\b" as a prompt terminator.  I have never seen
        this in the wild.
    <p>
        This is all well and good, except for the fact that some lpmuds, and possibly others, assume some
        quite bizarre semantics at the client end.  They'll assume that the text up to the prompt terminator
        be spirited away into some other prompt buffer - and any text they send from then on be displayed
        before the prompt.
    <p>
        <table border=1>
            <tr><td>sent from mud<td>expected to be displayed<td>displayed under 'telnet'
            <tr><td>100/100&gt;[IAC GA]<td>100/100&gt;<td>100/100&gt;
            <tr><td>You are hungry.\r\n<td>You are hungry.<br>100/100&gt;<td>100/100&gt;You are hungry.
        </table>
    <p>
        This is indeed what tinyfugue does, and a few others. If done carefully, it needn't break muds that are doing it sensibly.
    <p>
        The sensible way to do this, done in Abermuds and perhaps a few others, is to send "100/100&gt;\rYou are hungry.\r\n100/100&gt;".  This has the downside that not all the prompt gets wiped if the message is shorter than
        the prompt.  ESC[2k could be used for this if the mud knows it has a client that supports it.  This does lead to a nasty
        race condition, though, so perhaps the magic prompt marking approach does have merits.
        <h2>Client Identification</h2>
        This is specified in <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1091.html">RFC 1091</a>.
        Server sends IAC DO TELOPT_TTYPE, client sends IAC WILL TELOPT_TTYPE, server
        sends IAC SB TELOPT_TTYPE SEND IAC SE, client sents IAC SB TELOPT_TTYPE IS [terminal-type] IAC SE.
    <p>
        The client should not send out a useless generic name like "ansi" or "vt102" (or worse, "linux"). Instead
        it should send out a name like "zmud", "mushclient", "lyntin".  This allows the authors of the mud server
        to make decisions based on what the mud client is, and what the known capabilities are.  It might be
        desirable to encode version number of the client there in some way, too, but there's no precedent for doing
        this.
    <p>
        If the server doesn't understand the terminal type, it can request another one, and the client can
        go through a list. For example, zmud, vt102, ansi, unknown.
    <p>
        <h2>Window Size</h2>
        The server may need to know how big the clients window size is, for various reasons - where to
        wordwrap, how much to page, how big to make tables, etc.  For this reason the client should
        implement the NAWS option,
    <p>
        The server sends IAC DO TELOPT_NAWS, the client sends IAC WILL TELOPT_NAWS. It then immediately,
        and whenever the window size changes (even if its just a case of the window staying the same size
        and the font size changing), sends the server the window size.  The server makes no requests. I've
        seen some clients that agree to do NAWS and then await a IAC SB TELOPT_NAWS SEND IAC SE from
        the server before actually sending it out.  This is wrong wrong wrong.
    <p>
        The format of the NAWS subnegotiation is specified in <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1073.html">
            RFC 1073
        </a>.
        To quote -
<pre>
   The syntax for the subnegotiation is:
      IAC SB NAWS WIDTH[1] WIDTH[0] HEIGHT[1] HEIGHT[0] IAC SE
   As required by the Telnet protocol, any occurrence of 255 in the
   subnegotiation must be doubled to distinguish it from the IAC
   character (which has a value of 255).
</pre>
        Not doubling the 255 is a common error that doesn't show up very often, but can lead to
        the telnet stack getting into an inconsistent state, and possibly ignoring all future
        input.  Also remember, that the width and height are in network byte order (big-endian).
        <h2>Titlebar Setting</h2>
        Xterm and other terminals support setting the titlebar, with the following sequence.
        <code>\33]0;</code>string<code>\a</code>
        This could be used by a mud to display status info that isn't appropriate for a prompt,
        such as player name and mud name and location within the mud.

        <h2>Mud Specific Protocols</h2>
        <h3>Compression : MCCP</h3>
        <a href="http://www.randomly.org/projects/MCCP/">MCCP</a> is quite a nice
        spec that provides a way to compress data sent from the mud to the client
        with zlib. Quite wide client and server support.
        <h3>Hypertext : Pueblo</h3>
        Pueblo was the first client to support hypertext stuff. I can't find any
        documentation on the protocol they used.  It's supported by Pueblo, and
        partial support in mushclient.
        <h3>Hypertext : MXP</h3>
        <a href="http://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/mxp.htm">MXP</a> is an open spec supported
        by both zmud and mushclient.  It's implemented as a telnet option and is quite
        nice to implement on a server-side.  Client-side of course will be rather tricky.
        <h3>Hypertext : IMP</h3>
        <a href="http://www.firebolt.com/IMP-rfc.php">IMP</a> appears to be a reinvention of MXP.
        Only one client (fireclient) supports it,
        there's no formal spec, it doesn't use the telnet protocol as its framework.
        <h3>Hypertext : MIP</h3>
        This closed spec has an obnoxious licence that forbids technical commentary of it.
        Only one client (portal) supports it.
        <h3>General : MCP</h3>
        MCP is the <a href="http://www.moo.mud.org/mcp/">Mud Client Protocol</a>. It's oriented
        towards MOOs, so much so that it is actually impossible to implement on a mud with
        prompts.   There seems to be nobody to contact about it.
    <p>
        It's a metaspec which various packages can be placed on top of. For example, there's
        a module for sending files to the client for local editing, another for transferring
        userlists, one for sending timezone information to the server.
